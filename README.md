Welcome to my repository for my Computer Science/UX Design capstone project! I have designed and developed an iOS application for the Fabulous Fox Theatre in St. Louis, MO. At the time of creation (Spring 2024), this venue currently doesn't have an app available for download in the iOS or Android app stores. My target audience includes guests ages 25-55. Below you will find a video link explaining my created app.
