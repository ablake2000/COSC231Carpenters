Welcome to my repository for my Computer Science/UX Design capstone project! I am designing a mobile application for the Fabulous Fox Theatre in St. Louis, MO. This venue doesn't have an app available for download in the iOS or Android app stores. For my project, I am designing and developing a mobile app on the iOS platform. My target audience includes guests ages 25-55. One of my main design focuses includes accessibility as I want the app to be even user-friendly for the elderly and individuals with disabilities or impairments.
