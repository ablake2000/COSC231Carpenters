Welcome to my repository for my Computer Science/UX Design capstone project! I have designed and developed an iOS application for the Fabulous Fox Theatre in St. Louis, MO. At the time of creation (Spring 2024), this venue currently doesn't have an app available for download in the iOS or Android app stores. My target audience includes guests ages 25-55. One of my main design focuses includes accessibility as I want the app to be even user-friendly for the elderly and individuals with disabilities or impairments.
